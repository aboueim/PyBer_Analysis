# PyBer_Analysis

## Overview of Analysis

In this project, I aim to analyze ride-sharing data using several python libraries such as pandas and matplotlib to obtain new insights to be utilized by a company CEO. In doing so, I will create a summary dataframe in which ride-sharing fares data is shown given the type of city (i.e., rural, suburban, and urban) in which the rides were given. Besides, I will restructure the dataset using pivoting and resampling to achieve new dataframes required to visualize time-series data, which allows for comparing ride-sharing data between different city types during a specific timeframe. The results of these analyses will help firm decision-makers to make more insightful decisions based on the disparities found within ride-sharing data, given the time and location.
