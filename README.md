# PyBer_Analysis

## Overview of Analysis

In this project, I aim to analyze ride-sharing data using several python libraries such as pandas and matplotlib to obtain new insights to be utilized by a company CEO. In doing so, I will create a summary dataframe in which ride-sharing fares data is shown given the type of city (i.e., rural, suburban, and urban) in which the rides were given. Besides, I will restructure the dataset using pivoting and resampling to achieve new dataframes required to visualize time-series data, which allows for comparing ride-sharing data between different city types during a specific timeframe. The results of these analyses will help firm decision-makers to make more insightful decisions based on the disparities found within ride-sharing data, given the time and location.

## Results

The line chart below displays the ride-sharing graph for three types of cities: rural, suburban, and urban, from 2019-01-01 to 2019-04-28. The lines reveal almost similar patterns overall (except for slight differences in minor fluctuations; for example, while ride-sharing fares in urban and suburban cities increase in early January, it decreases for rural cities. Besides, all ride-sharing fare values for the three city types fluctuate slightly and show minor peaks in this period (In late February for all three, and another rise for rural cities' sum of fares in early April). However, the total fares for each type of city differ meaningfully along this timeframe. While rural cities' total fares varies between 0 to 500 $USD in this period, total fares for suburban cities and urban cities fluctutae between 700 to 1500 and 1600 to 2500 $USD, respectively. The total fares for these
